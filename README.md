# igclone
I want to practice HTML and CSS, and also in future JS on this project.

🤓 Already learned and practiced:
- Basic Git commands!
- Grid and Flexbox
- Overlaying div with another div
- and that's all... for now.

📝 Todo list
- [x] Make comments and likes appear after hovering on photo
- [ ] Make header always on top of the screen
- [ ] Make website responsive
- [ ] Photos should have their own subsite with all comments
- [ ] Multiple photos in one post
